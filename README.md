# HexSoftwares_Project1_Thabiso

Hello, I'm Thabiso. In this video (https://www.loom.com/share/60d10c0eb43749608b15a2afc1035b9a?sid=c0b993a2-9b3b-47db-b009-b022fd2765ea), I present an overview of my initial project at Hexsoftwares. The process began with importing necessary modules and retrieving the dataset from Kaggle. I then examined the data types, fundamental statistics, missing information, and the distributions of numerical attributes. Further analysis was conducted on categorical features and their connection to the target variable.
